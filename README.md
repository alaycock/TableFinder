TableFinder
===========

For the website tablefinder.info.

To do list, in order of priority
 * ~~Fix login functionality. If using a static password, get it out of the source code, if using unique passcodes, get that going.~~ Done. Users are setup by the admin and emailed a random password.
 * ~~Move from XML file to a database.~~ Done.
 * ~~Find and remove submission flaws (XSRF)~~ XSRF was not an issue since the site is cookieless.
 * ~~Refactor the drawing interface, lots of duplicate code~~ Refactored, but still could be better.
 * ~~Revamp admin interface~~ Stripped it down, functionality will be added as necessary.
